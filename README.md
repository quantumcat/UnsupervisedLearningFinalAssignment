# Galaxy Clustering Analysis â€“ Unsupervised Machine Learning Capstone

This repository contains the code, figures, and final report for my **Unsupervised Machine Learning** capstone project, in which I performed end-to-end clustering of galaxies using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

As part of the course requirements, I analyzed a large sample of galaxies using photometry, redshift, and morphological features, applying multiple unsupervised learning techniques to discover natural groupings without prior class labels.

I compared and evaluated:

* **K-Means**
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
* **Agglomerative Clustering**
* **DBSCAN** (exploratory tuning)

Clusters were validated against physical classifications using the **BPT diagram** for the emission-line subset.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Findings

* **Best Model:** K-Means with *k* = 3, PCA-reduced photometric data.
* Strong alignment between photometric clusters and spectroscopic classes (Ï‡Â² p < 0.001).
* Demonstrated that photometric clustering can serve as a scalable proxy for galaxy classification in large surveys, reducing dependency on full spectroscopy.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

* **Source:** [SDSS CasJobs](https://skyserver.sdss.org/casjobs/)
* **Attributes:** Photometric magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z), colors, spectroscopic redshift, morphological parameters, and emission-line fluxes for validation.
* **Selection:** 13 â‰¤ modelMag\_r â‰¤ 20, 0.003 â‰¤ z â‰¤ 0.25
* **Sample sizes:**

  * Photometry branch: \~100k galaxies
  * Emission-line subset: \~89.8% of photometry branch after S/N filtering
